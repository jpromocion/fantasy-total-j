  'numberFire',
  'numberFire is the next generation sports analytics platform. We take the unstructured and misleading data that exists all around sports and mine it for unprecedented insight that allows us to predict player and team performance better than any competitor.

The first step of our process involves digging into the box score. We know that it means a lot more to throw for 300 yards against the Steelers than it does against the Browns, so why simply use yards as an indicator for how good a quarterback is? Using a series of mathematical models, we break down the action in order to have a better and more accurate understanding of what teams and players are performing well and which are paper champions.

The next step of process involves using the power of predictive and regressive modeling to more accurately project future performance. Using our advanced metrics combined with state-of-the-art predictive algorithms, we leverage the power of science to come up with the most accurate, data-driven projections around.

We do all the number crunching - all you have to do is win. And win you will: if you used our fantasy projections instead of the platform defaults, you''d have a 30% higher chance of winning your league.',

  'FantasyData',
  'FantasyData was founded in 2008, and has grown to become a leading sports data company, providing real-time and post-game feeds across all major sports to both the fantasy and other industries.

FantasyData was created by CEO Scott Gimpel out of necessity when a need for sports data feeds on a different project was met with a lack of market options and steep pricing for start-ups from incumbent competitors. Our first few years in operation were marked with slow organic growth by providing NFL feeds to various fantasy companies. Starting in 2013, FantasyData made a push into the global sports data market by launching new sports and more comprehensive coverage. Today, we provide general and fantasy-specific feeds for all major professional and college sports, golf, NASCAR and top domestic & international soccer leagues.

Headquartered in Philadelphia PA, FantasyData is privately held and debt-free, servicing more than 150 clients globally from fantasy & gaming to mobile, web and broadcasting industries.',

  'Fantasy SP',
  'FantasySP is a fantasy sports site born out of necessity for my own fantasy sports needs back in 2007. I was in college, studying to get my degree in history and in my spare time would build FantasySP. The original idea was simple: to figure out a better way to get the news about your players faster than opponents in my league.

I had no idea what FantasySP would be or if it was even worth building at the time, but I knew I would use it for my own needs. If others decided to use it too that would be great. I quit my job and gave it a shot fulltime to see how far I could take it.

From that basic idea grew a ton of other ideas and features over the years that became industry standards as of today. I was one of the first to invent the tech and business model playbook that has been imitated by dozens of companies with millions of dollars in funding.

Today we have a wide set of features, offering users multiple tools and services to help manage their fantasy teams. We can take you all the way from draft season up until the final week of your fantasy season.',
